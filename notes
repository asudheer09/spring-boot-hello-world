Two ways to create spring boot project
1. using https://start.spring.io/ website
2. create a maven project and add all dependecies.

in Spring/Spring boot, there is a container called IOC (Inversion Of Control) which is responsible to create any object.
Once object got created we can get that object from that container.

design pattern is a solution for re-occuring problems.

bean=object

IOC container is design pattern, which is responsible to create an bean, and manages the bean life cycle and
provide dependency injection.

In Spring every java class is treated as a bean.

Dependency Injection:
for example

Class A{
 B b = new B(); // tight coupling
 b.m1();


}

class B{

void m1(){

}

}

class A is depending on class B, now class B will get injected into class A by using IOC container.

There are diffrent types of dependency injections there:
1. setter injection
2. constructor injection
3. field injection


interface Dao{
public void displayData();
}

class MySqlDaoImpl implements Dao{

public void displayData(){
sout("mysql");
}

}

class OracleDaoImpl implements Dao{

public void displayData(){
sout("oracle");
}

}


class Test{
Dao dao=new OracleDaoImpl();
dao.displayData();
}
